# Cloud-Anagram-Finder
This is a reupload of a project I did for a cloud computing module at uni.

The task for this project was to create a program that could process a collection of 10,000 e-books and return a list of all anagrams
that it found.

This was written in Java and used Apache Hadoop, as well as using Google Cloud Platform.

I also included my report for the project so it makes a bit more sense.
